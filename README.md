Zior Park - PENGUIN

To North Pole
Keep moving on
O oh my lord
Why you tryna stop me

My great fantasy is blurry
My old clothes is buried
My old documents I burned it
On the glacier I'm staring at other side
I just signed with the small shop
Big wings small cage with lil magpies
Testing just done take it my partner
Linchpin Mr Park making new products
Lord distribute my works to the Hollywood
My igloo's melting I'ma get house in Malibu
New school new typhoon
There's a bunch of coward
They're always jealous and
Afraid of fxxkin' new
I forgot what was my color when I was born
I can only see black and white on my coat
It ain't complain just saying
Would be hard to walk without jokes
Already my steps funny you know

I'm walkin' on
Frozen ground to North Pole
I'm only one
Here's maybe no one knows
Oh oh
Look at my funny steps
Oh oh
I forgot what was my plan
Oh oh
Fxxk off I'm a psychopath
Oh oh oh oh
Can't stop my feet to North Pole

My great fantasy is blurry
My old clothes is buried
My old documents I burned it
On the glacier Im staring at other side
Winter's coming inside my fantasy's darken
My life looks so invaluable
But still god keep calm
Oh but I'm still
Cocky oh like Kim Kardashian
There's no sign
Empire state of my mind
Hollywood of my mind
Stumble every time like a bird
Maybe don't know how to use my arms yet
It's not a concept
Goin' to Promised land
Maybe it's a far from North Pole
Need new mindset

I'm walkin' on
Frozen ground to North Pole
I'm only one
Here's maybe no one knows
Oh oh
Look at my funny steps
Oh oh
I forgot what was my plan
Oh oh
Fuck off im not a psychopath
Oh oh oh oh
Can't stop my feet to North Pole
To North Pole
Keep moving on
O oh my lord
Why you tryna stop me
